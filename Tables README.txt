Poster Tables READ ME

There are three files in this project. 

One R Markdown Notebook;
"tables for maize meeting 2020.Rmd"  

Two datasets called by the script;
"genes_within_TEs_features.txt"
"matTE_closest_gene_is_MEG_v2.txt"

The included code was created using an R markdown notebook. 

This code was created to make a table looking at the closest gene to maternally imprinted TEs to see if there is evidence of an interaction. 
It was also to make a table looking at the genes within TEs and if the TE itself was imprinted.
